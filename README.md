## Introduction

> Gitlab Suricate is a Python tool that enables you to **monitor your Gitlab stats** and **notify your team** when you feel that they need a reminder.

> The current implementation allows you to inform your team about the non reviewed merge requests but the final goal is to make Gitlab Suricate a Hub between Gitlab and others collaborations platform like Jira, ... (ex of feature : Automatically change the Jira ticket status when related PR is open, ....)

## Installation

> A **Dockerfile** and a **Makefile** is provided to you. Just by launching `make all` in the root dir of the project, you'll be able to connect inside the docker container and launch the main .py script.


## Disclaimer

> "Booooh ! Why don't you write test ?" : Don't worry, i'm a big software tests advocate ! Just that i shipped this small piece of code fastly as a small utils for a project, i didn't have the time to write them yet.
